*gf-user* is a Vim plugin to provide a framwork to extend |gf|.  Though |gf|
is one of the most useful commands in Vim, it has the following problems:

- The file to be opened is based on the word under the cursor.
- It's not possible to specify the cursor position for the opened file.

Sometimes you might wish |gf| used more text around the cursor to detect the
file to be opened and the initial cursor position.  For example,

- While reading output from diff(1), go to the hunk under the cursor.
- While editing files for an MVC framework, go to the view file corresponding
  to an action of the controller under the cursor. 

Though it's not hard to implement each extension, it's a bit troublesome to
synthesize all extensions.  |gf-user| provides a framework for the extensions.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.3 or later
